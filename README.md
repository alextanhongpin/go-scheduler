# go-scheduler
REST-based cron scheduler


## User story 

```
As a developer,
I want to schedule Cron jobs without redeploying the server,
In order to execute job at a later time
```

Requirements
- create new job, but delete old job first
- delete a job
- list the pending jobs, and their next execution date
